======================================
Borland Build Instructions for
STLport 4.5 with Borland CBuilder 6
======================================

1) Unpack the STLport sources.

2) Change directories to the STLport root (i.e. "cd STLport").

3) Make STLport

     -To make single-threaded static STLport library: make
     -To make single-threaded dynamic STLport library: make -DDLL
     -To make multi-threaded static STLport library: make -DMT
     -To make multi-threaded dynamic STLport library: make -DMT -DDLL\

4) Resulting libraries are in STLport\lib

Note: You may need to change the parameters to "md" and "rd" in bcb60.mak
and bcb60mt.mak before building.
