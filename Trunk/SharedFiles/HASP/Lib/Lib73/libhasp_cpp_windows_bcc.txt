This library is not the precompiled library (~288kb) that comes with LDK 7.3's API.

1. when changing the API library, make sure the vendor code is entered correctly in the embedded (HaspDefs),
2. remember to replace the .lib files in the solution.
3. overwrite the HASP's Include folder's *.h files with the new API's
    (i.e. hasp_api.h ,hasp_api_cpp.h ,hasp_api_cpp_.h ,haspdiag.h)
